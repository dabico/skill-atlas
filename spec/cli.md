# Skill Atlas

CLI tool used for mining and visualising skills in a Git repository directory tree.

## Context

### Problem

Users want to scan Git repositories hosted on VCS for the skills they contain.
The status-quo is that they have to manually clone, run some Bash commands and manually inspect each one.

### Outcome

With this tool, a user would be able to simply run:

```shell
skill-atlas scan https://github.com/githubtraining/hellogitworld.git
```

And get an overview through a TUI of each skill found in the repository, along with a short description preview.

## Skill definition

Skill Atlas follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

A skill is a directory that contains a `SKILL.md` file.
The file starts with YAML frontmatter, followed by a Markdown body with the skill's instructions.

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # required
├── scripts/          # optional
├── references/       # optional
└── assets/           # optional
```

### Frontmatter

| Field           | Required | Constraints                                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`          | Yes      | 1-64 characters. Lowercase letters (`a-z`), digits (`0-9`) and hyphens only. Can't start or end with a hyphen or contain `--`. Must match the parent directory name. |
| `description`   | Yes      | 1-1024 characters. Says what the skill does and when to use it.                                                                                                      |
| `license`       | No       | License name, or the path to a bundled license file.                                                                                                                 |
| `compatibility` | No       | 1-500 characters. Environment requirements, e.g. target product, system packages, network access.                                                                    |
| `metadata`      | No       | Map of string keys to string values.                                                                                                                                 |
| `allowed-tools` | No       | Space-separated list of pre-approved tools. Experimental.                                                                                                            |

Minimal valid `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract PDF text, fill forms, merge files. Use when handling PDFs.
---
```

The TUI preview uses the `description` field.

### Invalid skills

A `SKILL.md` that breaks the specification still appears in the results, marked as invalid.
Examples: YAML that doesn't parse, a missing `description`, or a `name` that doesn't match its directory.

Each invalid skill lists every rule it breaks, e.g.:

- `name "PDF-Tool" contains uppercase letters`
- `name "pdf" doesn't match directory "pdf-tools"`

### Validation details

Where the specification page is silent, Skill Atlas matches the [skills-ref](https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref) reference validator:

- Top-level fields outside the 6 above are errors, e.g. `unexpected fields: argument-hint, model`.
- YAML scalars are read as strings, so `version: 1.0` in `metadata` is the string `"1.0"`.
- `name` is NFKC-normalized before the checks, and "lowercase letters and digits" includes non-ASCII ones.
- For a `SKILL.md` at the repository root, the parent directory name is the repository name from the URL.

## Scan command

```shell
skill-atlas scan [--ref <branch|tag>] [--exclude <pattern>]... [--include-tests] <git-url>
```

- The first version accepts 1 remote Git URL, over HTTPS or SSH. Local paths aren't supported.
- Without `--ref`, the scan uses the remote's default branch (`HEAD`).
- `--ref` takes a branch or tag name. Commit SHAs aren't supported. An unknown ref fails the scan with an error.
- `--exclude` skips `SKILL.md` files by path. The flag is repeatable.
- `--include-tests` scans skills in test directories too.
- Both flags are described under [Excluded paths](#excluded-paths).
- Cloning uses [go-git](https://github.com/go-git/go-git). The `git` binary isn't required.
- Clones are shallow (depth 1). The scan doesn't need history.
- The results show the commit SHA that was scanned.
- Public repositories over HTTPS need no credentials. Private repositories over HTTPS aren't supported.
- SSH URLs authenticate through the SSH agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`). Host keys are checked against `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
- Cloning never prompts. If the clone needs input it can't get, the scan fails with an error, e.g. `authentication failed for <url>`.

### Scan scope

The scan walks every tracked file in the clone, except `.git/`.
It has no ignore list of its own, since a fresh clone only contains tracked files.
Only the [excluded paths](#excluded-paths) are skipped.

A `SKILL.md` nested inside another skill's directory is a separate skill.

The scan ignores symlinks, both to files and to directories.
Each skill appears once, at its real path, and the scan never reads outside the clone.

### Excluded paths

Repositories keep example skills in test data, for instance under `src/jvmTest/resources/skills/`.
The scan skips these by default and counts them.

A `SKILL.md` is excluded when any of these holds:

- A directory above the skill's own directory is a test directory.
- Its path matches an `--exclude` pattern.

Excluded files are counted and never parsed.
Symlinks and `.git/` stay ignored and aren't counted.
The TUI shows the count (see [TUI](#tui)).

#### Test directories

The scan checks every directory between the repository root and the skill's own directory.
The skill's own directory name is never checked, so `.claude/skills/tests/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/tests-maintenance/SKILL.md` stay.

A directory is a test directory when its name:

- Equals `test`, `tests`, `testdata`, `test-data`, `test_data`, `testfixtures`, `__tests__`, `fixtures` or `__fixtures__`, in any letter case.
- Ends in `Test` or `Tests` right after a lowercase letter or digit, e.g. `jvmTest`, `commonTest`, `integrationTest`. These are Kotlin and Gradle source sets.
- Ends in `-test`, `-tests`, `_test` or `_tests`, in any letter case, e.g. `integration-tests`, `e2e_tests`.

`--include-tests` turns this rule off. `--exclude` patterns still apply.

#### The `--exclude` flag

`--exclude <pattern>` takes a [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) pattern.
Pass the flag more than once to add patterns. Both `--exclude <pattern>` and `--exclude=<pattern>` work.

- Patterns match the `SKILL.md` path relative to the repository root, with `/` separators.
- A pattern without `/` matches a name at any depth: `fixtures` matches `a/fixtures/x/SKILL.md`.
- A pattern with a leading or inner `/` matches from the repository root: `/docs` and `skills/old` match only at the top.
- `**` matches any number of directories: `**/old`, `skills/**/draft`. It must fill a whole path segment, so `a**b` is an error.
- A pattern that matches a directory excludes everything below it. A trailing `/` limits the pattern to directories.
- A leading `!` re-includes paths that an earlier pattern matched. The last matching pattern wins. Unlike git, `!` can re-include a file inside an excluded directory.
- `!` patterns only undo other `--exclude` patterns. They don't override the test-directory rule.
- An empty or malformed pattern is a usage error (exit 2).

### State

The tool stores no state.
The clone goes into a temporary directory, which gets deleted before the tool exits.
Results are discarded after the scan.

## TUI

Split view: skill list on the left, details of the selected skill on the right.

- Header: repository URL, ref, short commit SHA, skill count, invalid count. When the scan excluded any `SKILL.md`, the counts also show the excluded count, e.g. `2 skills, 0 invalid, 2 excluded`. Without exclusions the header has no excluded count.
- List pane: skill `name`, with an `[invalid]` badge on invalid skills.
- Detail pane: path of the `SKILL.md` relative to the repository root, full `description`, other frontmatter fields, and validation errors for invalid skills. Below that, the full Markdown body, rendered.
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> switches focus between the panes. j/k scroll the detail pane while it has focus.
- <kbd>/</kbd> filters the list by name, description and path. <kbd>Esc</kbd> clears the filter.
- <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> quits.
- A scan with no skills shows `No skills found` in the list pane. When exclusions removed every `SKILL.md`, it shows `No skills found (2 excluded)`.
- The list shows the directory name when a skill has no usable `name`.
- Footer: key hints.
